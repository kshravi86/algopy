/* Flowers
You and your K-1 friends want to buy N flowers. Flower number i has cost ci. Unfortunately the seller does not want just one customer to buy a lot of flowers, so he tries to change the price of flowers for customers who have already bought some flowers. More precisely, if a customer has already bought x flowers, he should pay (x+1)*ci dollars to buy flower number i.
You and your K-1 friends want to buy all N flowers in such a way that you spend the least amount of money. You can buy the flowers in any order.

Input:

The first line of input contains two integers N and K (K &lt= N). The next line contains N space separated positive integers c1,c2,...,cN.

Output:

Print the minimum amount of money you (and your friends) have to pay in order to buy all N flowers.
